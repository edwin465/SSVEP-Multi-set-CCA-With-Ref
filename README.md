# SSVEP-Multi-set-CCA-With-Ref

## Multiset CCA and Multiset CCA with sine-cosine reference

This code shows the comparison study between the standard canonical correlation analysis (CCA), the Multi-set CCA (MsetCCA), and the Multi-set CCA with sine-cosine reference (MsetCCA-R) for SSVEP recognition.
